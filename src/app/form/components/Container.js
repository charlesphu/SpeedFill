// This is the floating green container in the form page. Should include a title and subtitle, the children can be passed
// into the component rather than hardcoding them in the component itself.

// For example, the "Your Resume" component will create a container with said title and subtitle, then the
// higher level component will pass in the dropzone as well as the text area in the children prop
